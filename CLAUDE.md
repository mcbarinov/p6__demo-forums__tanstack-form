# Project Guidelines

## Getting Started

- **Always read README.md first** - Before starting work, read the README.md file to understand the project context, tech stack, and setup

## HTML/CSS Philosophy

- **Simplicity first** - Keep HTML and CSS as simple as possible
- **No unnecessary complexity** - We don't need beauty, we need functionality
- **Less is more** - The smaller and simpler the code, the better
- **Minimal styling** - Use only what's needed for basic layout and readability
- **Avoid over-engineering** - Don't add extra divs, classes, or CSS unless absolutely necessary

## Code Quality

- **Always run linter after changes** - Execute `just lint` after making code modifications to ensure code quality
- **No disabling linter rules without permission** - Never use `eslint-disable` or similar comments without:
  1. Asking for permission first
  2. Adding a clear comment explaining why the rule must be disabled in this specific case
